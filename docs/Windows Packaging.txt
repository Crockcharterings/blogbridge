Windows Package Building Instructions

1. Goals and Prerequisites

We build Windows package with Advanced Installer. At the moment of writing I
have version 3.1.1 at my workbench. The goal of this procedure is to build
the distributable BlogBridge application installation package. The package
should be presented as single EXE file.

2. Package naming conventions

Installation package should always be named in the following way:

blogbridge-x.y.exe

where 'x' and 'y' are major and minor version numbers correspondently. This
naming requirement is imposed by updates architecture assumptions.

Ant task.
