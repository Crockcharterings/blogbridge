NOTES ON HOW TO BUILD A DMG DISTRIBUTION

JAR BUNDLER and ADVANCED INSTALLER

Jar Bundler - Tool on Mac used to create the correctly structured directory for a .app bundle. With Advanced Installer (on PC) Jar Bundler is not needed.

Advanced Installer - Runs on PC to create a .zip version of the app bundle.

ICONS

Icon Composer - Mac OS X Application to make .icns files. Drag and drop .tif files for each size (or it will do its bes to scale.)

.icns files - Special magical icon files for Mac. Include different sizes etc. 

APP BUNDLES

Info.plist - Preferences file that describes contents of an app bundle. 

Apple/Mac creator code for BlogBridge: BRID

 

DISTRIBUTION
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/SoftwareDistribution/index.html "Introduction to software distribution"

- Disk Image - DMG files, get mounted as storage devices on the file system

- Internet-Enabled Disk Images - Upon downloading by Safari will automatically be processed, mounted, opened, and if it's a single file, placed on the desktop. If more than one file then the finder window is automatically opened.

hdiutil - Command line program to create .DMGs.

SHELL COMMANDA

Create the dmg:
hdiutil create <dmg file> -imagekey zlib-level=9 -srcfolder <.app folder>

Internet enable it:
hdiutil internet-enable -yes <dmg file>


CAVEATS

- When using Advanced Installer to create bundles you get a particular version of the Java Application Stub. Need to verify that it's the latest one.

- Also, the info.plist file is version needs to be verified.

- I think the way to verify that is to use the tools on the latest Mac OS X to create a new .app file for some random test and see what file it used for App Stub.
