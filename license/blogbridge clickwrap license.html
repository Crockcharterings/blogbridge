The term "you" means the company, entity
or individual who is acquiring  the license to use the Product under this

under the GNU GPL.  This license is provided as an alternative to licensing
under the GNU GPL to those users who do not want to use software subject to the

     "Application") and the BlogBridge Service ("the
     Service", and the Application and the Service together, is referred
     to as the "Product").</li>
 <p>To the  extent that the Product enables you to access
 (on-line or otherwise) materials not supplied by us ("Content"), you
 should be aware that such Content is the property of the applicable Content owner
 and may be protected by applicable law.  This Agreement grants you no rights
 to Content.</p>
 <li><b>License Restrictions</b>
 <p>
      Except as expressly permitted herein, you may not make or distribute
      copies of the Software or electronically transfer the Software from one computer
      to another or over a network. You may not decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, attempt to discover the source code of the Software, or
      otherwise reduce the Software to a human-perceivable form (except to the
      extent applicable laws prohibit such restrictions). You may not modify
      the Software or create derivative works based upon the Product. You may
      not rent, lease, distribute, sublicense, or lend the Product. This
      Agreement provides the terms and conditions under which you are licensed
      to use the Software. It is not an agreement for the sale of the Product
      to you. </p></li>
   <li><b>Amendment and Termination.</b>
       <p>We may terminate your use of the Product and remove any content within
       the Service if we reasonably believe that you have violated or acted
       inconsistently with this Agreement. We may also at any time modify
       (including charging a fee) or discontinue providing the Product. We may
       do either of these things with or without prior notice. We will not be
       liable to you or any third-party for any of these actions. Your
       continued use of the Product constitutes consent to any such amendments
       or changes. On termination, you must destroy all copies of the Software
       in your possession.  Sections 2-10 survive any termination of this
       Agreement.</p></li>
    <li><b>Intellectual Property Rights</b>
        <p>This license gives you limited rights to use the Product. All title,
        ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the
        Product and any copies thereof are vested in and shall remain in us.
        The Product is protected by the copyright laws and other intellectual
        property laws of the United States and international treaties. The
        structure, organization, and code of the Product, including, without
        limitation, any associated data or file formats embody valuable
        copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property and
        confidential information of ours. You must maintain all proprietary
        notices on all copies of the Software. Trademarks shall be used in
        accordance with accepted trademark practice, including identification
        of trademark owners' names. Trademarks can only be used to identify
        printed output produced by the Product and such use does not give you
        any rights of ownership in that trademark. Except as expressly state
        above, this Agreement does not grant you any intellectual property
        rights in the Product. All third party trademarks are the property of
        their respective owners.</p></li>
     <li><b>Disclaimer of Warranties</b>
     <p>
         THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND
         TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. SALAS ASSOCIATES
         FURTHER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
         IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
         PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. SALAS ASSOCIATES AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO
         NOT AND CANNOT WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS YOU MAY OBTAIN BY
         USING THE PRODUCT. THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
         PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT REMAINS WITH YOU. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
         THAT YOU DOWNLOAD AND/OR USE THE PRODUCT AND ALL THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS
         MADE AVAILABLE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OR THROUGH THE SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN
         DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
         DAMAGES TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE
         DOWNLOAD OR USE OF THE PRODUCT AND SUCH THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS. SOME
         STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS OF AN IMPLIED WARRANTY,
         SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER LEGAL
         RIGHTS THAT VARY BY STATE/JURISDICTION.</p></li>
      <li><b>Limitation of Liability</b>
          <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL SALAS ASSOCIATES, ITS SHAREHOLDERS, SUBSIDIARIES,
          AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVISORS OR ITS
          SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY MONEY DAMAGES,
          WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
          PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
          FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS
          INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS), WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF
          CONTRACT, TORT, (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT
          LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF
          OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY OR ITS
          REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
          BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE
          ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p></li>
       <li><b>Basis of Bargain</b>
       <p>
           The Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability set forth
           above are fundamental elements of the basis of the agreement between
           us and you. We would not be able to provide the Product on an
           economic basis without such limitations.</p></li>
        <li><b>Submissions</b>
        <p>
            We appreciate and will consider any comments you may have on the
            Product, our Site, service, or ideas you may have on how to improve
            them. We are not required to hold such
            feedback in confidence, and such feedback may be used by us for any
            purpose without obligation of any kind, but nothing herein
            restricts the use of such feedback or ideas relating thereto by
            you.</p></li>
         <li><b>U.S. Government Restricted Rights</b><p>
             The Software is a "Commercial Item," as that term is
             defined at 48 C.F.R.  2.101, consisting of "Commercial
             Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software
             Documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R.  12.212
             or 48 C.F.R. 227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
             12.212 or 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable,
             the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software
             Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users (a)
             only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are
             granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and
             conditions herein. </p></li>
          <li><b>Governing Law and General Provisions</b><p>
              This Agreement will be governed by the laws in force in the
              Commonwealth of Massachusetts excluding the application of its
              conflicts of law rules. This Agreement will not be governed by
              the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
              Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. If
              any part of the Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it
              will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement,
              which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.
              You agree that the Product will not be shipped, transferred, or
              exported into any country or used in any manner prohibited by the
              United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws,
              restrictions or regulations. This Agreement shall automatically
              terminate upon failure by you to comply with its terms, in which
              event you must destroy all copies of the Software. This Agreement
              may be amended only by a writing executed by both parties.</p></li>
