<h1>What are BlogBridge Keywords?</h1>
<p>You can provide BlogBridge with a simple set of keywords and phrases which 
  are used as way to know what are some of the topics you are interested in. Many 
  people put favorite names (their own :-), countries, companies, politicians, 
  artists, etc. as keywords. You can choose as many or few as you like.</p>
<h2>How are Keywords used to help you find information you care about?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You may indicate (on the Tools/Keywords... dialog box) that all Keywords 
    be highlighted whenever they occur in an article (this is set by default).
    This makes it easy for you to see where the topics you care about are mentioned.</li>
  <li>On the Article list there is also an option to display <em>only</em> Articles 
    which have keyword matches. Other Articles are filtered out, therebyy giving 
    you a way to focus on the Articles that probably matter to you most.</li>
  <li>In the Feed List, the number of Articles with keyword matches are counted 
    and indicated right next to the Feed Name. This is another handy way to quickly 
    find those Articles which are likely to interest you.</li>
  <li>And in the BlogStarz! configuration, you can indicate how heavily you want 
    to take Keyword matches into account when determining the Silver Starz!</li>
</ul>
