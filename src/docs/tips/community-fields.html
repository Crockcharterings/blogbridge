<h1>Community Fields</h1>
<p>All users in the BlogBridge community can share things they know about a Feed. Neat, eh? Whatever changes one person makes, all the others can see, so please be responsible!
<p>The "Country of origin" field tells you what country the author(s) of a Feed are working from. This may not be obvious, but if you know what it is, then please
tell the rest of us.
<p>The "Tags" classify a Feed in one way or another. Often these are subjective tags, like Funny or A-List. Different people may 
feel differently about where a certain feed should be filed or classified. In the future we will show reports of what Feeds are classified under what 
tags and use that information to help you discover new Feeds of interest.
