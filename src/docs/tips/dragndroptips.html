</head><h1>How does Drag and Drop work?</h1>
<p>Feeds can be moved via Drag and Drop. They can be moved from one position in a Guide to another. 
They can also be moved to a different Guide. In both cases you first need to click on the Feed and hold the mouse down for
a moment until it is 'picked up.' You can then move the mouse, while keeping the left button down to the destination. </p>
<p>If the destination is a different Guide, then move the mouse directly onto the Guide icon of the destination. The Feeds on the
the destination are displayed and you can then move the mouse to the right place within the target Guide</p>
