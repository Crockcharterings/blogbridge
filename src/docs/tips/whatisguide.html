<h1>What is a Guide?</h1>
<p>A Guide is simply a collection of Feeds which have been grouped 
  together for your convenience. Generally all the Feeds in a Guide are related 
  in one way or another. They might all be comics, or all be about Politics, or 
  be about Nuclear Physics. You are always looking at the Feeds of the current 
  Guide, which is the one who is clicked or selected in the Guide Panel. Many 
  operations apply to a whole Guide, for example, you can delete a Guide, create 
  a Guide, import a Guide, mark all the articles in a Guide as being read, etc.</p>
