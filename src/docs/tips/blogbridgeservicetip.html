<h1>Using the BlogBridge Service</h1>
<p>BlogBridge, the application you are running, uses a Web based, free, service, 
  to Provide many of its coolest features. As a user, most of this is behind the 
  scenes and invisible and behind to you. Here are the things you need to know:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Tools/BlogBridge Service... dialog box is your control center for the 
    BlogBridge Service. This is where you can set and change your password, as 
    well as control synchronization.</li>
  <li>The BlogBridge service is free. However you do need to sign up and activate 
    it. When you sign up (and provide an email and a password) you will receive 
    a confirmation email in your inbox. Once you click on the link, you are registed. 
    <strong>Note: </strong>If you don't click on this link, the service is not 
    activated, and BlogBridge runs in a stand-alone mode with slightly less functionality.</li>
  <li>One of the handy things the service does for you is <em>synchronization, 
    </em>which makes it easy to use BlogBridge from different computers, by storing 
    your personal setup, Guides etc on the service. On the Synchronization tab 
    of the Tools/BlogBridge Service... dialog you will see a Synchronize button. 
    Click this button for a two-way synch, or the little arrow button next to 
    it for a one way synch.</li>
</ol>
