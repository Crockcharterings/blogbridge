<h1>What is a Feed?</h1>
<p>A blog is the most common type of Feed. There are other kinds of Feeds, such 
  as perhaps weather reports, news bulletins, price notices, etc. Essentially 
  a Feed is a bunch of Articles on a certain topic. In a way, Feeds are the most 
  important element of BlogBridge. Here are the key ideas about a Feed. It has 
  name and a one or more articles. Many Feeds have a corresponding web site where 
  you can read the blog or feed with a conventional web browsers. It also has 
  URL, which refers to the feed in it's raw form, either RSS or ATOM. While this 
  is a crucial piece of information, you generally don't have to think about it.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that all the information in a Feed in provided 
  by the Feed author, either a blogger or a news site. BlogBridge can only <em>read</em> 
  feeds. Nothing you do in BlogBridge will affect what other people see. BlogBridge 
  is there to help you quickly discover, read and keep track of Feeds.</p>
<h2>Feed Properties</h2>

  Feed. There are the following &quot;Basic&quot; Properties:</p>
<ul>
