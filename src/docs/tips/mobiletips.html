<p>BlogBridge is well suited for people who use multiple computers. You can use 
  the BlogBridge Service to keep track of your Guides, Feeds and Keywords. By 
  Synching periodically (either manually or automatically) you can ensure that 
  your information is available from each computer. Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
  <li> When you install BlogBridge for the first time, register for the BlogBridge 
    Service. If you haven't done so yet, do it now using the Tools/BlogBridge 
    Service dialog box.</li>
  <li>When you install BlogBridge on subsequent computers, indicate your registered 
    email and password.</li>
  <li>Using the Tools/BlogBridge Service dialog box you can request that BlogBridge 
    synchronize all its settings with what is tracked on the Service. You can 
    do this by clicking the Synchronize... button, or requesting a periodic automatic 
    synchronization.</li>
</ol>
