<h1>How do I filter what I see?</h1>
To avoid information overload, BlogBridge has several handy ways to hide information that is not immediately important.
<h3><img src="blogstarscontrol.jpg" width="76" height="21" hspace=5 border="0" align="left">Seeing only highly rated Feeds</h3>
Look at the top of the list of Feeds and you will see the BlogStarz! Filter, which 
you can use to show and see only Feeds which have been rated at least the indicated 
number of Starz! Just click on a star and you will see only the corresponding 
Feeds. Of course to see every single Feed, just click on the leftmost star. 
<h3><img src="articlehidecontrol.jpg" width="100" height="22" hspace="5" border="0" align="left">Seeing only articles 
  that are unread or those that have Keyword hits</h3>
<p>Look at the top of the list of Articles and you will see the Article Filter, 
  which you can use to filter what Articles are shown. You can show only articles 
  which are still unread by you. You can also show only articles which have one 
  or more Keyword hits. Keywords are one of BlogBridge's keys to finding the stuff 
  you care about.</p>
