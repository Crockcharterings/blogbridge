<h1>What are Blogstarz?</h1>
<p>Wherever you see a Feed you will see a set of one through five BlogStarz!, 
  which are they key to BlogBridge's recommendations and ratings. It's very simple: 
  if you want to tell BlogBridge how much you like a certain Feed, just click 
  on the star. One star means you really didn't think much of the Feed, and five 
  BlogStarz is for when you consider the Feed a must-read.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between the Silver and Gold BlogStarz?</h2>
<p>Again simple: a silver star tells you BlogBridge's recommendation, and a gold 
  star says that you've rated the Feed yourself. You can actually customize exactly 
  how BlogBridge comes up with the silver BlogStarz, basically based on information 
  such as how many of your keywords matched and how many other Feeds point to 
  a certain feed. But remember, just click on the BlogStarz to turn them gold 
  and lock in your own rating.</p>
