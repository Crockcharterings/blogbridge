<h1>How does Unread work?</h1>
<p>BlogBridge keeps track of which articles you have read already. Articles which 
  are new (unread) are displayed with a <strong>bold title</strong>. Feeds containing 
  unread articles also are displayed with <strong>bold titles</strong>. This makes 
  it easy to quickly locate information you might want to look at.</p>
<p>There are several additional elements to the Unread feature in BlogBridge.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Preferences, you can indicate the number of seconds you should linger 
    on an article to consider it to be read</li>
  <li>You can also ask that all articles in a Channel automatically be marked 
    read as soon as you move on to another Channel</li>
  <li>You can even ask that all Channels and Articles in a Channel Guide be marked 
    read as soon as you move on to another Guide.</li>
  <li>There are commands to navigate directly to the next unread article, or just 
    the next unread in the current Channel Guide, or the next unread Article in 
    the current Channel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also remember that when you Synch with the BlogBridge Service, unread state 
  is also synchronized!</p>
