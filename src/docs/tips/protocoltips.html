</head><h1>What protocols or formats does BlogBridge support?</h1>
<p>You might have heard of formats such as RSS 1.0 and Atom and others. BlogBridge 
  supports all of them, so as a general rule you need not be aware nor concerned 
  about the format that a particular Feed happens to support or not support. Although 
  they are all pretty much equivalent, unfortunately there continueto be changes 
  and additions to these formats from time to time. BlogBridge will continue to 
  follow and support these changes so that you are insulated -- so don't worry 
  about them!</p>
