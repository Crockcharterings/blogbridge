<h1>Welcome to BlogBridge</h1>
<p>BlogBridge is very simple to use. But why do you need it? BlogBridge is a tool 
  for reading lots and lots of blogs, efficiently. Actually while Blogs are the 
  best known, there are other kinds of Feeds that are really interesting. BlogBridge 
  can read all of those. </p>
<p>So if you are interested in Blogging then this app is for you. It's a lot easier 
  than using your browser to stumble around from one web site to the next. With 
  BlogBridge you can find, filter and focus an amazing amount of information, 
  fast! (and it's free!)</p>
<h2>Feeds, Guides, and Articles</h2>
<p>BlogBridge is built around Feeds. There are many kinds of feeds, and 
  as we mentioned above, a blog is the most common. A feed is nothing more than 
  a stream of Articles that are being published or distributed by some web site.</p>
<p>Many different kinds of web sites have Feeds. They are often designated by an orange XML icon, 
  and called by different technical names such as RSS 2.0 and Atom. You don't need to know anything
  about these terms, because BlogBridge handles all that for you, behind the scenes.
<p>Articles are the content of Feeds - each Feed has zero or hundreds of Articles 
  on one topic or another. In a blog they are postings, for the New York times 
  feeds, they are actual Articles; for the weather report Feeds they are weather 
  reports. Get the idea?</p>
<p>BlogBridge lets you monitor a large number of Feeds. To help you keep things 
  straight, we organize sets of related Feeds in a Guide. You can have as many 
  Guides as you like, call them what you like, and even choose an attractive icon 
  to decorate your Guides. Guides are pretty simple. Just a group of related Feeds.</p>
<h2>Free BlogBridge Service</h2>
<p>One more thing. To make this really useful you can sign up for the FREE BlogBridge 
  service, which provides some handy goodies. Most importantly, you can save your 
  hard won, carefully crafted Guides on the service, so that whereever you are, 
  whatever computer you are using, you can grab those Guides and use them with 
  impunity. Yes impunity!</p>
<h4>Go Forth</h4>
<p>So that's it! In the next few screens you will be given a chance to sign up 
  for the service (all you need is an email and password - no credit card!) and 
  to choose from a few pre-made Guides to get you going. You can take them or 
  leave them - build your own Guides, it's easy!</p>
