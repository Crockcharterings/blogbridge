<p>External parsers gateway package. This package is intended to hide the details
of other parsers implementation by providing the unified interface to them. The rest
of BlogBridge application is isolated from the specific ways of parsing the content
by unified FeedParser interface and the results of parsing.</p>

<p>In order to parse some resource the following steps are required:</p>

<pre>
  IFeedParser parser = FeedParserConfig.create();
  FeedParserResult result;

  try
  {
    result = parser.parse(feedXmlURL, feedTitle, lastUpdateTimestamp);

    // Everything parsed fine -- processing of results
    IChannel channel = result.getChannel();
  } catch (FeedParserException e)
  {
    // Some parsing error happened -- handling
  }
</pre>

<p>The parser will register the activity for the updating of feed specified by title. It will
use the timestamp of last update to find out if the resource has been changed since then and
make the processing much faster. If the timestamp is not specified then the feed will be
fully fetched and parsed.</p>
